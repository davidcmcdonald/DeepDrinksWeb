<p>Deep Drinks Podcast (DDP) does not endorse the views or statements of any guest. DDP strives for deep conversations about deep topics, this includes harmful ideologies discussed responsibly.</p>
<br />

<h3 class="text-xl">My Approach?</h3>
<p>Deep Drinks is not a debate platform; my goal is to provide the best faith interpretation of the guest's ideas.</p>
<br />

<h3 class="text-xl">Why Discuss Bad Ideas?</h3>
<p>I believe that truth withstands scrutiny, and harmful ideas should be discussed. I worry that ostracisation tends to push those ostracised further into their dangerous ideologies and groups.</p>
<br />

<h3 class="text-xl">My Stance?</h3>
<p>I reject all forms of bigotry, racism, homophobia, and transphobia. I despise partisanism and believe all ideas should be evaluated based on their merits. I endeavour to engage in honest discourse and will not treat someone differently for immutable characteristics.</p>

<br />

<h3 class="text-xl">Safe Space?</h3>
<p>DDP conversations can often cause distress to listeners as a result of the subject matter (mental illness, religious intolerance, homophobia, bigotry etc.), and as a result, viewer discretion is advised. I do my best to give content warnings and label episodes to help viewers decide which episodes to listen to.</p>
